            <h1>🤘 Hello, I'm Arthur Segato!</h1>
            <p>A 24yo Brazilian based in Portugal.</p>
            <p>
                I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and possess expertise
                in diverse areas such as game development, full-stack development,
                UI/UX design and video editing.

            <p>
                My passion lies in exploring virtual reality, cybersecurity, and
                advocating for open-source initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides technology I enjoy urbex, learn about different cultures &&
                languages, large goofy dogs, F1, cozy co-op games and cooking.
