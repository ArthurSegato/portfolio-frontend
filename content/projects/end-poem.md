The End Poem is a freehand poem written by musician Julian Gough that appears when the player finishes minecraft, before the credits. It has been in the public domain, under the CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, since 2022.

I created theendpoem.com for two main reasons: first, to dissociate the end poem from Minecraft/Microsoft, and second, to protect the domain from potentially malicious actors. I foresaw that someone would exploit the popularity of the name in a negative way, as the website receives about 300 accesses daily.

At first, I developed the website using plain html, css, and vanilla javascript. However, after learning vue.js and nuxt.js, I rewrote everything in nuxt.js. Now, it's deployed on the edge using Cloudflare Pages, just like this website here.
