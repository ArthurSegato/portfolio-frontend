I've created a wide variety of websites, from a portfolio as a graduation gift for my sister to establishing a virtual storefront for Kafhia bikini store, additionally, I've developed landing pages, created templates for sale on Fiverr (with API integration to fetch data from minecraft servers), and built several personal websites over time.

As those projects are no longer in use, I have released their code under the MIT license on GitHub, they remain accessible solely for the purpose of showcasing my progression in web development.
