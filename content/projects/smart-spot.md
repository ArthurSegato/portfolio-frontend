Smart Spot was an Android application developed for the Inovaweek 2018 event hosted by Vila Velha University. The application was specifically designed for internal use by students, teachers, and staff. Its features included real-time location tracking of teachers on campus, the ability to request support materials like erasers, pens, remote controls, etc., and a function to summon staff for minor repairs or adjustments to the equipment used in classes.

The application was developed by a team of 8 students, using Android Studio for the code and Photoshop for the UI/UX, the feature for tracking the position of teachers was implemented through Bluetooth beacons strategically installed in classrooms.
